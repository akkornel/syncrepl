class BaseCallback(object):
    """

    :class:`BaseCallback` is a class containing all of the callbacks which
    :class:`syncrepl_client.Syncrepl` may call.  It is implemented as a
    new-style class, with class methods (although
    :class:`~syncrepl_client.Syncrepl` doesn't care).

    This class exists for two reasons:

    * It documents each callback, the parameters the callback receives, and
      what the callback means.

    * It gives you a useful base class to sink unwanted callbacks.  If you only
      care about certain callbacks, you can implement them in your class, and
      let all the other callbacks percolate up to this class, where they are
      received and ignored.

    Another reason for using classes is because they can be stacked.  For
    example, if you want to handle callbacks, but you also want them to be
    logged, you can have your callback class use
    :class:`~syncrepl_client.callbacks.LoggingCallback` as a
    base class, and then set the
    :class:`~syncrepl_client.callbacks.LoggingCallback`'s
    :attr:`~syncrepl_client.callbacks.LoggingCallback.dest` attribute to the
    log sink (which could be :obj:`~sys.stdout`, or another file handle).

    .. note::

      If your class needs any kind of setup or initalization before it can
      receive callbacks, it is suggested that you implement your callbacks as
      instance methods, and then use normal class instantiation to do your
      preparation, before handing off the instance to
      :class:`~syncrepl_client.Syncrepl`'s constructor.

    def bind_complete(cls, ldap):
        """Called to mark a successful bind to the LDAP server.

        :param ldap.LDAPObject ldap: The LDAP object.

        :return: None - any returned value is ignored.

        This callback is used to indicate a successful bind, and to give you
        one opportunity to interact with the LDAP server, before the connection
        is taken over by the syncrepl search.

        For example, if you want to record the bind DN (which you might not
        know, if you are doing things like a SASL bind), or you want to
        retrieve the schema stored on the server, this is the time to do it!

        This is the very first callback to be called.  Once the callback
        completes, the syncrepl search will begin, and other callbacks will
        start coming in.

        .. note::

            Once the callback has completed, there is no guarantee that `ldap`
            will still be a valid reference.

        .. warning::

            If you start any asynchronous operations (which includes searches),
            those operations **must** be completed before this callback
            returns.

        .. warning::

            Please do not unbind `ldap` from the LDAP server!

        .. warning::

            Once the callback completes, this LDAP connection will be used for
            the syncrepl search.  **No other operations will be allowed!**
            If you want to communicate with the LDAP server after this callback
            completes, you will need to set up a separate LDAP connection.

            This callback is **not** used when you are in refresh-only mode.
            This callback is only used in refresh-and-persist mode.

        When receiving this callback, you know that the refresh phase has 
        completed, and your view of the directory is now consistent with the 
        LDAP server (at least, the part of the directory which 
        matches your search and your access).

        If you need to do any sort of synchronization with anyone else, this is 
        the best time to do it.  Once you return from this callback, the 
        persist phase will begin.

        If you are operating in refresh-only mode, instead of receiving
        this callback, the :class:`~syncrepl_client.Syncrepl`

        refresh-only mode, and the refresh phase of refresh-and-perist mode, 
        the addition may have taken place at any time since your last update.  
        In the persist phase of refresh-and-persist mode, a new entry has just 
        been added—or modified—such that it matches your search.
        
        Attributes which are not present in the record will not present in
        `attrs`.  Dict keys are attribute names, and dict values are arrays
        (to support multi-valued attributes).

        .. note::

            Just because the dict values are arrays, does not mean that all
            attributes are multi-valued.  The LDAP client does not know which
            attributes are single- and which are multi-valued, so it assumes
            that all are multi-valued.

            Also, all attribute values will come in as (in Python 2) :obj:`str`
            objects or (in Python 3) :obj:`bytes` objects.

            the type (or, in LDAP terms, the *syntax*) of an attribute, you
